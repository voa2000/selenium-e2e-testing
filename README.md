# Selenium

### Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.

A brief history of Selenium
Selenium was born in 2004 when Jason
Huggins, an engineer at ThoughtWorks,
was working on an application that
required lots of manual testing. He
developed JavaScript code that could
automate control of the browser, greatly
streamlining the test process. This code
came to be called “Selenium Remote
Control” and was open-sourced later
that year. Over the next few years, other
developers got involved in the project
and a few Selenium-related projects
were spawned, including Selenium Grid,
Selenium IDE, and Selenium WebDriver.
This increasingly powerful set of tools
is, as of now, essentially one fully
coordinated test framework.


• Test scripts can be written in any of these programming languages: Java, Python, C#, PHP, Ruby, Perl & .Net.

• Tests can be carried out in any of these OS: Windows, Mac or Linux.

• Tests can be carried out using any browser: Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari or Opera.

• It can be integrated with tools such as TestNG & JUnit for managing test cases and generating reports.

• It can be integrated with Maven, Jenkins & Docker to achieve Continuous Testing.

### But there surely has to be shortcomings right?

• We can use Selenium only to test web applications. We cannot test desktop applications or any other software.

• There is no guaranteed support available for Selenium. We need to leverage on the available customer communities.

• It is not possible to perform testing on images. We need to integrate Selenium with Sikuli for image based testing.

• There is no native reporting facility. But we can overcome that issue by integrating it with frameworks like TestNG or JUnit.
