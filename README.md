# Selenium

### Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.

• Test scripts can be written in any of these programming languages: Java, Python, C#, PHP, Ruby, Perl & .Net.

• Tests can be carried out in any of these OS: Windows, Mac or Linux.

• Tests can be carried out using any browser: Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari or Opera.

• It can be integrated with tools such as TestNG & JUnit for managing test cases and generating reports.

• It can be integrated with Maven, Jenkins & Docker to achieve Continuous Testing.

### But there surely has to be shortcomings right?

• We can use Selenium only to test web applications. We cannot test desktop applications or any other software.

• There is no guaranteed support available for Selenium. We need to leverage on the available customer communities.

• It is not possible to perform testing on images. We need to integrate Selenium with Sikuli for image based testing.

• There is no native reporting facility. But we can overcome that issue by integrating it with frameworks like TestNG or JUnit.
